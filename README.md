# WC_LUMINOUS
Adds new light sources to NodeCore
Far superior to the old "nc_light" in the following ways:
 - Coal Lantern
	- New Model With A More 'Nodecorian' Vibe
	- No More Broken Textures (Hopefully)
	- Can Be Emptied Without Being Broken Apart
	- Fuel Maximum Has Been Buffed
	- Recipe Cost Has Been Buffed
	- Occasionally Drops Ashes While Lit
 - Luxlamp
	- Being phased out by vanilla lantern.
	- Now Fragile and Uncraftable
 - Rushlight
 	- Cheap Light Source
 	- Doesn't Require Charcoal
 	- Lasts Approximately 25% As Long As A Torch
 - Egg Burner
 	- Incense Bowls!
 	- Uses Eggcorns For Fuel
 	- Dim Light, Long Duration
 	- Goes Out Faster When Carried
